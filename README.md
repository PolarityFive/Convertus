# Convertus
A converter between math bases. (2,8,10,16)

You can convert a number from and to Binary,Octal,Decimal and Hexadecimal. 

This was a fun Visual C++ project done in about a day for practice. 

The following problems have not been solved. 

#1: It doesn't check whether the user has entered data correctly.

#2: It doesn't use Arrays resulting in range problems. 
    
Other than that, it's working perfectly as far as I know. To whoever tests it, message me if you find a bug.
